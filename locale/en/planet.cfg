[space-location-description]
mercury=Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, with extreme temperature variations.
venus=Venus is the second planet in the solar system, known for its high temperatures and dense carbon dioxide atmosphere.
earth=Earth is the home of humanity and the only known planet to host life.
mars=Mars, known as the Red Planet, is covered in iron oxide and hosts the tallest mountains and largest canyons outside Earth.
phobos=The first moon of mars, Phobos is asteroid-like. Unlike earth's moon, phobos travels across the martian sky backwards due to the speed of the orbit along which phobos travels around mars.
deimos=The second moon of mars, Deimos is asteroid-like. 
asteroid-belt-inner=The inner asteroid belt is the only thing seperating Mars and Jupiter. It contains somewhere between 1.1 and 1.9 million asteroids, by recent estimates.
jupiter=Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system, featuring massive storms and 79 known moons.
saturn=Saturn is famous for its iconic rings made of ice and rock particles.
uranus=Uranus is a gas giant known for its blue-green appearance and tilted rotational axis.
neptune=Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, known for its powerful storms and deep blue color.
pluto=Although Pluto is no longer classified as a formal planet, its discovery marked the beginning of deep exploration of the outer solar system. Its icy terrain and orbital characteristics continue to captivate scientists.
asteroid-belt-outer=Also known as the Kuiper Belt, the outer asteroid belt contains a vast number of mostly ice and carbon-based asteroids, as well as many dwarf planets such as pluto and one of it's moons, charon.
luna=Luna is Earth's only natural satellite, its surface covered with craters and vast basalt plains. It is the starting point of human space exploration.

[technology-description]
planet-discovery-mercury=By observing the motion of stars and carefully probing the planets, scientists successfully discovered Mercury. This planet is the closest to the Sun in the solar system and has extreme temperature variations.
planet-discovery-venus=The discovery of Venus marked a further breakthrough in human exploration of planets. It is Earth's "sister planet," but its thick atmosphere and high temperatures make its surface conditions extremely harsh.
planet-discovery-earth=Earth, as the home of humanity, has been thoroughly explored and studied, and we have finally established its position and unique status in the solar system.
planet-discovery-mars=Mars, the "Red Planet," has become one of the most promising planets for human exploration of the solar system through telescope observation and landing probes.
planet-discovery-phobos=Phobos
planet-discovery-deimos=Deimos
planet-discovery-asteroid-belt-inner=The Main Asteroid Belt
planet-discovery-jupiter=Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system, has revealed its complex atmospheric system and rich moon system through the study of its powerful gravity and meteorological phenomena.
planet-discovery-saturn=Saturn is famous for its magnificent rings. The discovery of Saturn gave scientists a deeper understanding of gas giants, especially the mechanisms of its rings and gravitational forces.
planet-discovery-uranus=Uranus is the first planet discovered by telescope. Its extreme axial tilt and blue-green appearance make it a unique presence in the solar system.
planet-discovery-neptune=Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun. Through astronomical observations and theoretical deductions, scientists confirmed its existence and revealed its extreme climate and deep blue atmosphere.
planet-discovery-pluto=Although Pluto is no longer classified as a formal planet, its discovery marked the beginning of deep exploration of the outer solar system. Its icy terrain and orbital characteristics continue to captivate scientists.
planet-discovery-asteroid-belt-outer=The Kuiper Belt
planet-discovery-luna=Through careful observation of celestial bodies near Earth, scientists first recorded and explored Luna. This natural satellite of Earth became humanity's first target for extraterrestrial exploration.
